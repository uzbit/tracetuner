This file is part of TraceTuner, the DNA sequencing quality value, base 
calling and trace processing software. While providing a flexible interface 
and the capability to adopt the "pure" base calls produced by Phred, KB 
or any other original caller, it offers competitive features not
currently available in other tools, such as customized calibration of quality
values, advanced heterozygote and mixed base calling and deconvolving the
"mixed" electropherograms resulting from the presence of indels into a couple
of "pure" electropherograms. Earlier versions of TraceTuner were used by 
Celera Genomics to process over 27 million reads from both Drosophila and 
human genome sequencing projects and by Applied Biosystems, as a component 
of its SNP detection and genotyping software product SeqScape. TraceTuner 
implements an advanced peak processing technology for resolving overlapping 
peaks of the same dye color into individual, or "intrinsic" peaks. This 
technology was protected by US Patent #6,681,186. Currently, TraceTuner 
is an open source software, which has been used by J. Craig Venter 
Institute's DNA Sequencing and Resequencing pipelines.
